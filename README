THIS IS BETA SOTFWARE : Becareful!

DISCLAIMER: This project is not affiliated with or sponsored by the CentOS Project
in any way.

NOTICE: The setup.sh script is not meant to be run from a network connction.

Follow the instructions provided in the scripts. They should be run in the
following order.

1. setup.sh - Configures Networking
2. update.sh - Installs updates
3. install_pkgs.sh - Installs common server software.
4. enable_quotas.sh - Edits /etc/fstab and enables filesystem quotas
5. setup_services.sh - Setup of common server software.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you run the setup.sh script and have a static IP Address be sure to 
know the following information:

NETWORK NETMASK IPADDR DNS1 DNS2 GATEWAY


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need to run the setup program provided with CentOS to configure the 
firewall and other services that are not configured with the centos setup
tools.

Also, you will have to configure the MySQL server passwords by hand when done.
You may want to check out my DB-Tools for managing MySQL user accounts.


If you have a Minimal Server install you will need to insert the USB stick and
run dmesg.  You will be shown what device it is, ie, /dev/sdd.  Next you need
to do the following (If anyone knows why please email me):


fdisk /dev/[device provided by dmesg] 
press p
press q

get the partition provided by fdisk. ie, /dev/sdd1

you can now mount like this:

mkdir /media/usb
mount -t vfat /dev/sdd1 /media/usb

Next:

cd /root
tar xf /media/usb/centos-setup-tools.tar.bz2


Suggesting install is to put the archive on a usb stick and untar it to /root/

Before running the following script add a quota user to use as a prototype.

run: assign_quotas.sh - Turns on user quotas.  

Once the scripts are done you will find some example DNS files under /root/bind
they can be used as a starting point.  You will still need to learn how to install
them and set the correct permissions, ownerships and selinux contexts.
[ This may come some time in the future. ]


NOTE: Once you have configured your server and have added all accounts it is
suggested that you run the assign_quotas.sh script to set quotas for your 
accounts.


Please feel free to send patchs or comments.
	Have Fun!!
